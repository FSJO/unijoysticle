v0.3.1 - 2016-08-XX

- [NEW] iOS Client: Added Gravity mode. Allows you to move the joystick with the gravity
- [FIX] iOS Client: Resets Joy state allowing left/right/up/down to be alone


v0.3.0 - 2016-07-29 - CommVEx release

- [NEW] iOS Client: uses "angular position" instead of acceleration to simulate the wheel rotation
more reliable and enables new features like the handicap (see below)
- [NEW] iOS Client: new "handicap", "jump threshold" and "movement threshold" properties which
        simulate a faster wheel rotation, and adds threshold for jump and movement (no need to recompile for different riders/games)
- [FIX] iOS Client: AppStore compliant
- [FIX] iOS Client: UniJoystiCle mode calibrated for idling and jumping
- [FIX] iOS Client: UniJoystiCle mode shows a DPad instead of bits
- [FIX] ESP8266 Schematic: Uses Copper Pour both in Top and Bottom layers
- [FIX] ESP8266 Schematic: Uses bitmap in bottom layer
- [FIX] ESP8266 Schematic: uses DC Jack Barrel with thinner holes
- [FIX] ESP8266 Schematic: 4066 ICs use VCC and GND from Joystick.
		C64 works if power external power is off. Otherwise, the unknown
		state of the ICs was causing strange bugs on the c64.
		ESP8266 VCC is not used.
- [FIX] ESP8266 Firmware: prints "UniJoystiCle" + version via Serial (good for debugging)
