The Uni-Joysti-Cle is a __revolutionary__ device that allows you to play [your favorite Commodore 64 video game](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/c64-the-uni-games) with a unicycle.


This repository contains:

* the [firmware](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle/tree/master/server_cpp) that runs on the Wi-Fi receiver
* the [iOS client](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/unijoysticle/tree/master/client_ios) that sends the packets to the Wi-Fi receiver
